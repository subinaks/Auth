Goal of this test is to assert (to some degree) your coding and architectural skills. You're given a simple problem so you can focus on showcasing development techniques. We encourage you to overengineer the solution a little to show off what you can do - assume you're building a production-ready application that other developers will need to work on and add to over time.

**Create a simple signup/login system with the the following fields, UI doesn't have to be detailed, a basic form would suffice.**

- Email
- First Name
- Last Name
- Password
- Date of birth

### These are some aspects we pay particular attention to

* Shouldn't make use of any frameworks
* Must make use of OOP concepts
* Best security practices
* SOLID principles where appropriate
* git history with clear, concise commit messages so that we can analyse the thought process

### The following are optional but earn you bonus points

* Using any kind of Database Access Abstraction
* Unit tests
* Coding style guides, for example PSR-2

Good luck!
